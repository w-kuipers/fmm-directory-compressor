# FMM Directory Compressor

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

Compress a directory into a single .FSA file. This library was build for the Filmage Media Manager to create project directory structures.

## Installation

### Linux
#### Debian/Ubuntu

    sudo apt-get install fmm-directory-compressor

### Python API

    pip install fmmpy-directory-compressor
    
 Note the `pip` refers to the Python 3 package manager. In environment where Python 2 is also available the correct command may be `pip3`.


## Usage

### CLI
#### Compress directory
    fmm-directory-compressor compress-directory path/to/src path/to/dst

You'll be asked to provide a filename. A .fsa file will be generated.
If you are using windows, the compression might fail when your source directory contains paths that are longer than 260 characters. These file paths can be ignored with the `--skip-long-paths` flag, but with this method these files/directories wont be present in the compressed file. 

#### Decompress directory
    fmm-directory-compressor decompress-directory path/to/file.fsa path/to/dst
You'll be asked to provide a root directory name. The directory structure will be rebuild.

### Python API
The python wrapper yields the same functionality as the CLI application. Just include the library and you're ready to go.

    import fmm_directory_compressor

    ## Compress directory
    fmm_directory_compressor.compress_directory("path/to/src", "yourfilename", "path/to/dst")

    ## Decompress directory
    fmm_directory_compressor.decompress_directory("root-directory-name", "path/to/yourfile.fsa", "path/to/dst")
